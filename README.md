# scRNA-seq pipeline (nextflow)

`StarScope` provide a convenient to run the scRNA-seq workflow
which uses **starsolo** (https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR/blob/master/docs/STARsolo.md) 
and **Seurat** package (https://satijalab.org/seurat/) as the core modules to process scRNA-seq
data and generate a concise html report. 
The workflow was implemented by [**nextflow**](https://www.nextflow.io/).
